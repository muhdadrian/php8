//Another way to define constant is by using const keyword. 

const STATUS_PAID = 'paid';

echo STATUS_PAID;

//constant created with const keyword is defined at compiled time, while constant created with defined function is defined at runtime
//you can't define constant with const keyword within control structures such as loop and if else. But you could define constant using the define function within control structure
